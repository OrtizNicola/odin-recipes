# Recipes Project!

In this project I'm trying to get more confident with HTML, using the basic tags to display images and to create links that refer to other pages in my own project but also that link to websites on the internet.

This is going to be useful because it will be my first steps in web programming and the plan is to keep updating this project as I learn new things, so that this repo keeps track of my journey from a noob to an experienced web programmer.
